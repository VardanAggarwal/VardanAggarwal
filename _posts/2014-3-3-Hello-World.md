title: Whether to take coaching or not?
---

This is a question a lot of us face either as a student, a parent or a mentor. Whenever a student is at a critical junction in their academic life coaching is an option to think of and that’s when a student faces this question. Let’s see why coaching is important and how important it really is.

It is of no doubt that formal education in India is not good enough. A student cannot expect that he/she can achieve some major milestone on the basis of what they learn on daily basis in school and colleges without any extra efforts on their part. Major role of coaching is to provide that extra effort.

Coaching Institutes helps students in multiple ways:

* They provide a proper syllabus, study material and curriculum. This ensures that students are on right track and know what to study and from where.
* Classroom teaching helps in developing stronger basics and understanding concepts which otherwise may seem tricky and difficult to grasp.
* For competitive exams coaching provides quick tips and tricks that help solving tricky problems quickly. A lots of examples if covered in classroom helps student feel comfortable around such problems.
* One may lose concentration and track of studies by oneself. But coaching ensures a regular schedule.
* Knowing where you stand among all other students is necessary to ensure progress. Regular assessments in the form of tests and assignments helps in knowing where one stands and keeping track of progress.
* Coaching institutes provide a study environment to student. This leads to mutual growth of all the students.
* A good teacher also motivates and inspire This helps students in maintaining their focus on the target.
* Good coaching institutes also provide guidance to students as in what they should do and aim for.
* A good teacher also spends enough time on clearing doubts of the students. It helps student in converting their weak points into strong ones.

It is not necessary to take coaching and in general one should avoid coaching if possible as self-study helps a lot in personal growth. Consider following points before making a decision whether to choose self-study or not.

* If you don’t have a proper access to internet and at least one mentor then you should prefer coaching institute. While internet is full of information, a lot of it is misleading and contradictory. Relying on internet is useful only when you can spend a lot of time scraping through this information to extract the relevant knowledge.
* One can easily find a good syllabus and study material over internet, from some senior or friend. But it is not necessarily important that you can follow a curriculum. If you ever have trouble with self-discipline then coaching is your preferred option. Also a coaching institute which follows strict curriculum is essential.
* Not everyone needs a teacher to understand basics. If you are comfortable with books and understand concepts in one or two reads then coaching will appear a waste of time. Instead enroll for test series to keep track of your performance.
* A lot of tips and tricks can be found in study material and on internet. If you can practice a lot of problems by yourself then you don’t need a tutor to teach you tricks. But if you are a bit lazy towards practice then a few examples taught in class will be of great help.
* If you end up having a lots of doubts and don’t have anyone to help then coaching can be a great place for you. Not just teachers but fellow students will teach you a lot and clear many of your doubts. Peer to peer learning is the most important aspect of coaching that can’t be replicated anywhere else.
* If you choose to study by yourself then ensure that you participate in some mock tests to regularly assess your performance against other students and know progress. A bad result may be a little demotivating but it will also push you to work harder.
 

It is necessary to set your goals as to why you are going to take coaching and choose the one that can provide the same.

To summarize take coaching if

* You lack resources or a good study environment: Ensure that coaching you are going to have one.
* You are having trouble understanding basic concepts: Ensure that teachers focus on basic concepts in classroom and not run too fast.
* You can’t maintain a curriculum and lack self-discipline: Take coaching where strict discipline is maintained. It is no use taking admission and skipping classes daily.
* You are lazy to practice problems and need to learn tips and tricks to solve problems: Ensure that a lot of problems are solved in classroom and active participation of students is demanded. Regular assignments is a must.
* You have a lot of doubts and not a good study circle: Ensure that you take admission in an institute where you can connect with fellow students. Also tutors should be approachable with doubts and there should be facilities where you can connect with other students.
While a perfect coaching only provide great benefits to students real world coaching institutes are far from perfect. This leads to students facing a lot of problems. Ultimately students have to make compromise on some front. Knowing what is necessary for you and which institutes offer that can affect your experience a lot. A good institute can make your life while a wrong choice can lead to lost hopes and depression. First find all information about an institute, understand your needs and join only when you are completely satisfied.
